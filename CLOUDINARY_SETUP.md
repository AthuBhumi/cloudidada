# üîß Cloudinary Setup Guide for CloudIdada

## Current Issue:
‚ùå Invalid cloud_name: `dqrn9m8ts`
‚ùå Images showing 404 error: https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/...

## Solution Steps:

### Step 1: Create Cloudinary Account
1. Go to: https://cloudinary.com/users/register/free
2. Sign up with your email
3. Verify your email account

### Step 2: Get Your Credentials
After login, go to Dashboard:
- **Cloud Name**: (like `dy1234abcd`)
- **API Key**: (like `123456789012345`)
- **API Secret**: (like `abcDefGhiJklMnoPqrStuVwxYz_1234`)

### Step 3: Update .env File
Replace these lines in `.env`:
```
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_real_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_real_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_real_api_secret
```

### Step 4: Restart Server
```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
node production-server-direct.js
```

## Alternative: Use Local Storage (Temporary)
If you want to test without Cloudinary, I can create a local storage version.

## Current Status:
‚úÖ Upload working (files saved to memory)
‚úÖ API working (files list working)  
‚úÖ Dashboard working (shows file info)
‚ùå Image URLs (404 because invalid Cloudinary)

Would you like me to:
1. Wait for you to setup real Cloudinary account?
2. Create a local storage version for testing?
3. Use a different image hosting service?
